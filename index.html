            <h3><b>Why I Took This Class</b></h3>
            <p>I took this class because I want to be a software engineer when I grow up. In addition, when I was introduced to this class, I decided that I might as well give it a go to see how it will turn out.</p>

            <h3><b>What I Want to Get Out of This Class</b></h3>
            <p>I hope to learn some basic coding skills for languages like HTML and Java. I feel that it will make it easier for me to understand other languages in the future.</p>

          <div class="article">
            <h3><b>Difference Between UX and UI</b></h3>
            <p>When it comes to <b>UI (User Interface)</b>, everything is more focused on the visual side of the product. A good UI would be organized and it should be easy to identify it's parts. Everything is based on aesthetics.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <b>UX (User Experience) </b>would be more on the usability of the product. A good UX should allow the user to easily use and navigate around the product.</p>

            <h3><b>Thoughts on CSS</b></h3>
            <p>So far this week, we've been learning about something called CSS(Cascade Style Sheets). I found out that this it's used to decorate and color webpages. There are three ways of implementing CSS to a website. My favorite is creating external CSS files, becuase I find it more organized and it woun't get in the way of the html coding.</p>

          <h2><b>Responsive Design</b></h2>
          <h6><i>September 28, 2016</i></h6>
          <div class="article">
            <h3><b>Thoughts on Responsive Design</b></h3>
            <p>I think that responsive design is very convenient for users who can't access websites through computers. It resizes content to adjust to the screen size of the current device. It may take longer to code the website, but it'll give users a better UI to work with.</p>

          <h2><b>Digimon Go</b></h2>
          <h6><i>October 17, 2016</i></h6>
          <div class="article">
            <h3><b>Thoughts on Digimon Go</b></h3>
            <p>I think that the Digimon Go project was a good way to implement our HTML knowledge onto making actual websites. I actually liked this project beacuse it wasn't that hard for me but of course I still needed to look up some things. This also helped me narrow down my knowledge on what I can and cannot do with CSS.</p>

          <h2><b>Media Queries</b></h2>
          <h6><i>October 17, 2016</i></h6>
          <div class="article">
            <h3><b>Thoughts on Media Queries</b></h3>
            <p>Media queries are really useful for the users so that media elements can be easily viewed on different screen sized devices. I think this was really fun to make like the block family. It was more complicated than the CSS that we learned before this.</p>

          <h2><b>Basic Javascript</b></h2>
          <h6><i>October 24, 2016</i></h6>
          <div class="article">
            <h3><b>Thoughts on Basic Javascript</b></h3>
            <p>I think that the basics of javascript are easier than other languages like CSS because it relies more on logical thinking. I also had experience with other languages like C, so I'm assuming that they're simillar. I'm really looking foward to more in depth lessons on javascript.</p>

          <h2><b>Conditionals (Aliens)</b></h2>
          <h6><i>October 24, 2016</i></h6>
          <div class="article">
            <h3><b>Thoughts on Conditional Excersise</b></h3>
            <p>Just like the Digimon Go project, I think that the conditional excersise about aliens was a good way ttest out knowledge on basic javascript. It also helped us by getting to know how other people think when it comes to coding. This was a good introduction to coding with a partner.</p>
