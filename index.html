            <h3><b>Why I Took This Class</b></h3>
            <p>I took this class because I want to be a software engineer when I grow up. In addition, when I was introduced to this class, I decided that I might as well give it a go to see how it will turn out.</p>

            <h3><b>What I Want to Get Out of This Class</b></h3>
            <p>I hope to learn some basic coding skills for languages like HTML and Java. I feel that it will make it easier for me to understand other languages in the future.</p>

            <h3><b>Difference Between UX and UI</b></h3>
            <p>When it comes to <b>UI (User Interface)</b>, everything is more focused on the visual side of the product. A good UI would be organized and it should be easy to identify it's parts. Everything is based on aesthetics.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <b>UX (User Experience) </b>would be more on the usability of the product. A good UX should allow the user to easily use and navigate around the product.</p>

            <h3><b>Thoughts on CSS</b></h3>
            <p>So far this week, we've been learning about something called CSS(Cascade Style Sheets). I found out that this it's used to decorate and color webpages. There are three ways of implementing CSS to a website. My favorite is creating external CSS files, becuase I find it more organized and it woun't get in the way of the html coding.</p>
