      <h3><b>Why I Took This Class</b></h3>
      <p>I took this class because I want to be a software engineer when I grow up. In addition, when I was introduced to this class, I decided that I might as well give it a go to see how it will turn out.</p>

      <h3><b>What I Want to Get Out of This Class</b></h3>
      <p>I hope to learn some basic coding skills for languages like HTML and Java. I feel that it will make it easier for me to understand other languages in the future.</p>
